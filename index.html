                Hi, I’m David Xu, a finance and data-driven problem solver studying Mathematics at the University of Waterloo. 
                I specialize in financial analysis, data processing, and market research, with experience as an Investment 
                Research Analyst at Global Alpha Capital Management and as a co-founder of a Personal Finance Platform.

                Beyond work, I enjoy playing basketball and hiking, embracing challenges both on the court and on the trails. 
                I’m always looking for innovative ways to combine finance, technology, and strategy. Feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
